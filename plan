LEVEL I - create the whole DB from scratch

create functions:
    get the results CSV from google docs
    turn the whole CSV to a dict of it rows
        handle the keys - turn them to english
    add more keys to document (a SINGLE document)
        uniques date, and more - look at the scheme!
    create the collections scheme, using mongo engine's DynamicDocument scheme
        https://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/defining-documents.html
    handle the sad/happy_reasons list in the values when adding the doc to the DB
        will need to plan it according to the sad/happy_reasons collection
        - go over the value, split it by ','
        - go over the list's elements. for each, add a refernce to the reason document, in the X_reasons collection
        it will look like:
            create_db
                add_document (for each element in the CSV dict)
                    create_reason_field (for each document)
    create the X_reasons collections
        yes, create them separately from the forms collections.
        - it might be slower, but less error prone!

LEVEL II - append to the DB instead of recreating it

LEVEL III - handle CSV versions, in order to update the WHOLE DB with changes that were made, instead of only appending to it
